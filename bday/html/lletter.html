        const text = `Hi, I know this is quite late, but belated happy birthday. This is the gift that I was talking about when I said I was doing something for you, so hopefully, you still appreciate it even if it was late and even if we're not really in good terms anymore.

I'll keep this short since I don't think you'd care anyways. So, thank you for all the memories we've had, thank you for all the calls, thank you for all the things you've done for me. I really appreciate it a lot, and I won't deny that I really had fun with you and I really loved spending time with you.

I wish you the best, and also in your art journey â€”your commissions, your animations, your cosplays. I'll be rooting for you, and hopefully, you'll be successful.

And yeah, I think that's all I'm going to say. Again, belated happy birthday, and I love you platonically. Thank you for everything, and this is probably the last message you'll hear from me, so yeah.`;
